## About

We supply an in-vehicle stack with software orchestrators. Your assignment is to utilize our in-vehicle stack and software orchestrators to construct your own scenario or replicate the scenarios provided in our [Sample Scenarios](#sample-scenarios).

The tech stack in this challenge showcases complex in-vehicle services and workloads, utilizing the vehicle‚Äôs computing resources and capabilities, as well as other in-vehicle applications.

Enjoy the process of bringing your vision to life!

## Sample Scenarios

Here is a list of potential scenarios your team could develop. Feel free to invent your own scenarios too. Let your creativity shine ‚òÄÔ∏è and have fun!

### Provided Sample Scenario

#### Smart Trailer Scenario Overview
The system detects that a smart trailer is being connected to the vehicle. A signal is raised to the orchestrator to start up the necessary providers and applications to manage the smart trailer. These include a Digital Twin Provider, which exposes signals from the trailer to higher-level applications, and a Smart Trailer application, which consumes these signals. The provided smart trailer application prints the value of a property it subscribes to, the `TrailerWeight`.

The first diagrams in the [Eclipse Ankaios](./eclipse-ankaios/README.md) and [Eclipse BlueChi](./eclipse-bluechi/README.md) depict this provided sample scenario.

The in-vehicle-stack is started with Eclipse Chariott, Ibeji, Agemo, Freyja, and an Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker inside the orchestrator environment.

##### Dynamic Orchestration
This use case demonstrates a simple example of dynamic orchestration. A [script](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/smart_trailer_use_case/scripts/) (one implemented for each orchestrator) will be run to monitor Ibeji and detect when the trailer is connected. The script will continuously poll for the "Trailer Connected" Digital Twin Provider, and print "NotFound" until it is started. You can simulate the trailer being connected to the vehicle by starting the ["Trailer Connected" Digital Twin Provider](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/smart_trailer_use_case/digital_twin_providers/trailer_connected_provider/). This provider will register itself with Ibeji, the script will detect this change, and start up the ["Trailer Properties" Digital Twin Provider](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/smart_trailer_use_case/digital_twin_providers/trailer_properties_provider/) and the [Smart Trailer Application](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/smart_trailer_use_case/applications/smart_trailer_application/). This shows a simple example of reacting to an event in the vehicle by starting up other workloads.

##### Trailer Applications
The Trailer Properties Provider supports the ManagedSubscribe operation so that the Smart Trailer Application can specify that it wants to receive the `TrailerWeight` property's value every 10 seconds. Using the provided configuration, Freyja is configured to sync the `TrailerWeight` every 3 seconds to a mocked cloud endpoint (which will log the signal data on standard output). See the [Cloud Connectivity Doc](./docs/in-vehicle-stack/azure-cloud-connection.md) for instructions to synchronize signals to an Azure Digital Twins instance in the cloud. The [Digital Twin Model](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/smart_trailer_use_case/digital-twin-model/dtdl/trailer.json) defines the digital twin model for the trailer, which is used as a reference for the Digital Twin Providers and Applications.

##### Run the use case
Once you've chosen an orchestrator and gone through their environment setup steps, please refer to [Ankaios's Dev Environment README](./eclipse-ankaios/README.md#startup-check-before-development) or [BlueChi's Dev Environment README](./eclipse-bluechi/README.md#running-the-smart-trailer-example-with-bluechis-devcontainer) for instructions on running this scenario.

#### Wheelchair Assistant Scenario Overview
In this scenario we try to provide a handicapped person an easier access to a vehicle and thus more mobility. Our system detects that a handicapped person with a wheelchair is approaching a vehicle and aims to provide complete support by personalizing to the individual needs of the user. The system demonstrates a full driving scenario from arriving at the car to reaching the desired destination with maximum support from automation software.

A signal is raised to the orchestrator to start up the necessary providers and applications to manage the wheelchair as well as to make adjustments inside the car. These include a Digital Twin Provider, which exposes signals from the wheelchair to higher-level applications, and a Wheelchair Assistant application, which makes use of and reacts to these signals. In order to start our orchestra, the tools we use are: Eclipse Chariott, Ibeji, Agemo, Freyja, and an Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker.

##### Ankaios as Orchestrator

Ankaios is developed specifically for automotive use cases. It's independant of communication frameworks like SOME/IP, DDS or REST API.
It also does not depend on systemd or any specific systems and can be started with any init system.
With this it's possible to dynamically startup an application that is only required in a particular situation. Since Ankaios supports ASPICE processes, it can be used widely by leading car manufacturers.
For these reasons Ankaios fits in perfectly for the wheelchair scenario.

##### Dynamic Orchestration
This use case demonstrates a more complex example of dynamic orchestration.

At the beginning the car is parked and in the init state when the person arrives at the parking lot. While approaching, the person unlocks the car and it switches to the open state in which the door is unlocked. In order to simulate this, Digital Twin Provider "carkey_unlock_provider" sends the signal to set the cars state to open. Another Digital Twin Provider "wheelchair_distance_decreasing_provider" simulates the approaching process. Meanwhile a [script](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/wheelchair_assistant_use_case/scripts/) will be run to monitor Ibeji and detect when the handicapped person is approaching the vehicle. The script will continuously monitor the wheelchair distance from the vehicle and based on the distance read, automatic configuration of the car starts to make the entry experience as effortless as possible. This automatic configuration is implemented by the [Wheelchair Assistant Application](./in-vehicle-stack/scenarios/wheelchair_assistant_use_case/applications/wheelchair_assistant_application/). Through this application, the front and back doors open up, the steering wheel adjusts to a higher position and the driver seat is adjusted to the back and lowered. Once this is done, the car is in Hold state and ready to be turned on which is simulated by the "car_on_provider". Once the driver enters and turns on the ignition, the doors close and steering wheel and seat go back to their default state. Once the person arrives at the desired destination, the described process takes place in the reverse way to make sure they leave the car comfortably. This process is achieved by the "car_off_provider", "wheelchair_distance_increasing_provider" and the "car_lock_provider".

Every action and state change through transition is uploaded to the cloud through Freyja cloud syncronization and can be visualized by Azure.
All our services are registered by Chariott.

##### The Wheelchair Assistant Applications

This application takes care of the software implementation corresponding to the person arriving at the car, getting in ,driving, getting out and leaving the car.
 - When a person approaches the car, the car lowers itself, opens the front and the back doors. The seat and the steering wheel get adjusted in order for the person to get in.
 - A mechanical setting (ramp or a crane) can be used for getting the wheelchair inside the car.
 - Once the person gets in, the seat and the steering gets adjusted back for driving, while closing the backdoor.
 - On reaching destination, the car is lowered. As the backdoor opens,the wheelchair is retrieved.
 - The seats and steering get adjusted for the person to get out of the car. Once they"re out, everything gets readjusted to normal position.

##### Run the use case


#### Hack Challenge - Extend the use case
Take a look at the source code for the Digital Twin Model, Digital Twin Providers, and Applications used in this example and add to them or use them as a reference to create your own! See the [references](#useful-references-for-creating-and-enhancing-sample-scenarios) to help guide you as well.

When developing new workloads to run in the orchestrator environments, it is recommended to:
1. Write the code for your workload in the language of your choice.
1. Build a container image for it.
1. Push it to a container registry. You can create an [Azure Container Registry](./docs/azure/azure_container_registry_instructions.md#aditional-information) with your [Azure Subscription](./docs/azure/azure_code_redeem_instructions.md)
1. Follow the orchestrator-specific instructions for plugging your container image into the environments.
    - If you are using Eclipse Ankaios, please see [Workload Development](./eclipse-ankaios/README.md#workload-development) section.
    - If you are using Eclipse BlueChi, please see the [Managing Workloads](./eclipse-bluechi/README.md#managing-workloads) section.

Here are a few suggested ways to extend this use case, but feel free to use your imagination to come up with your own as well!

- Extend the smart trailer application to adjust some body control or powertrain functions based on the weight of the trailer to ensure a smooth trip.

- Create a web UI that displays the signals which are synced to the cloud.

- Create your own application which leverages vehicle signals to implement a different use case, such as a data collector.

### Other Sample Scenarios
- Leverage OpenAI to enhance the vehicle‚Äôs user experience. You could develop an application that uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model to power an in-vehicle virtual assistant.

- Consider using OpenAI to enhance our software orchestrators, effectively creating intelligent orchestrators! OpenAI could optimize workload placements across compute nodes and/or cloud based on factors such compute usage, memory usage, network coverage, and latency.

- Create a web user interface application, such as a dashboard, that displays the various workloads' health.

## Useful References for Creating and Enhancing Sample Scenarios

This section offers guidance for creating a new sample scenario or extending the [Provided Sample Scenario](#provided-sample-scenario). While it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources, it aims to steer you in the right direction. If this section does not provide the guidance you need, please refer to the respective project‚Äôs documentation. See [Projects Involved](#projects-involved) for the project links.

### In-Vehicle Stack
If you are using the [In-Vehicle Stack](./in-vehicle-stack/README.md), these references may be useful.

- [How do I override a configuration file for a service in the in-vehicle stack?](./docs/in-vehicle-stack/config-overrides.md)
- What is Chariott's default Service Discovery's URI?
    > The default URI for the Service Discovery is `http://0.0.0.0:50000`. Please see Chariott's FAQ for more info on [Service Discovery](#chariott).
- After I pushed a newly created image to my container registry, how do I get the orchestrator to start my container image?
    > If you are using Eclipse Ankaios, please see [Workload Development](./eclipse-ankaios/README.md#workload-development) section. If you are using Eclipse BlueChi, please see the [Managing Workloads](./eclipse-bluechi/README.md#managing-workloads) section.
- After I created a new component or edited an existing component, why should I push its image to a container registry?
    > Pushing an image to the container registry is the recommended approach because it enables the orchestrators to easily reference that image, pull it from the container registry and run it as a container.
- After I decided which orchestrator to use, why should I use run its devcontainer using VSCode?
    > Running the devcontainer environment through VSCode offers an interactive approach for development. However, this is just a suggestion. You also have the option to use a devcontainer without VSCode. The devcontainer environment guarantees that you have the necessary tools to interact with each orchestrator and the in-vehicle software stack. While you can choose to develop on your local machine, you would need to install the required tools yourself. Please see [Install additional software](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_install-additional-software) if you wish to install additional software into your VSCode devcontainer.
- After I edited the configuration file of a service, what should I do next?
    > You will need to restart the smart trailer scenario. If you are using Eclipse Ankaios, please see [Workload Development](./eclipse-ankaios/README.md#workload-development) section. If you are using Eclipse BlueChi, please see the [Managing Workloads](./eclipse-bluechi/README.md#managing-workloads) section.

## In-Vehicle Software Stack Overview

The in-vehicle stack comprises Eclipse Ibeji, Eclipse Agemo, Eclipse Freyja, and Eclipse Chariott. This stack enables a universal vehicle model to be used across different vehicles, dynamic management of vehicle signal topics for publishing and subscribing, synchronization of in-vehicle signals to a cloud-based digital twin, and the development of applications without the need for specific knowledge about the location of the resources they use.

We provide two software orchestrators, Ankaios and BlueChi, to orchestrate the in-vehicle stack. Feel free to choose either for this hackathon challenge.

## Projects Involved

### In-Vehicle Software Stack
- [Eclipse Agemo](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/Agemo): Agemo incorporates a Pub Sub Service, a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service that facilitates publish/subscribe operations for in-vehicle applications, including but not limited to Eclipse Ibeji and Eclipse Chariott. This service has the capability to register with Chariott, enhancing its discoverability by other applications such as Eclipse Ibeji. It offers dynamic creation and management of topics.

- [Eclipse Chariott](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott): Chariott operates as a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service, offering a unified interface for application interaction. Chariott enables [Service Discovery](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott/blob/main/service_discovery/README.md), allowing provider applications to promote their capabilities by registering with Chariott‚Äôs service registry. Consumer applications in need of specific resources and capabilities can discover them via Chariott‚Äôs service registry.

- [Eclipse Freyja](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/freyja/): Freyja enables seamless synchronization between the vehicle‚Äôs digital twin and its cloud-based digital twin. This synchronization allows for a consistent and unified digital representation of the vehicle across both platforms.

- [Eclipse Ibeji](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/ibeji): Ibeji is designed with the goal of enabling a digital depiction of the vehicle‚Äôs state and capabilities. It achieves this through an adaptable, open, and dynamic architecture that provides access to the vehicle‚Äôs hardware, sensors, and capabilities. This extensible framework allows for a comprehensive and accurate representation of the vehicle‚Äôs current status and potential functionalities.

### In-Vehicle Software Orchestrators
- [Eclipse Ankaios](https://eclipse-ankaios.github.io/ankaios): Ankaios provides workload and container orchestration for automotive High Performance Computing (HPC) software . While it can be used for various fields of applications, it is developed from scratch for automotive use cases and provides a slim yet powerful solution to manage containerized applications. It supports various container runtimes with Podman as the first one, but other container runtimes and even native applications can be supported. Eclipse Ankaios is independent of existing communication frameworks like SOME/IP, DDS, or REST API.

- [Eclipse BlueChi](https://github.com/containers/bluechi): BlueChi is a systemd service controller intended for multi-node environments with a predefined number of nodes and with a focus on highly regulated ecosystems such as those requiring functional safety. Potential use cases can be found in domains such as transportation, where services need to be controlled across different edge devices and where traditional orchestration tools are not compliant with regulatory requirements.
