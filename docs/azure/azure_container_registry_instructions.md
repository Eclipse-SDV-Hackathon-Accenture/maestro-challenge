# Azure Container Registry 

Azure Container Registry is a managed registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0 allowing you to create and maintain your container images in Azure.

We have pre-built container images for the in-vehicle software stack comprised by Eclipse Ibeji, Eclipse Agemo, Eclipse Freyja, and Eclipse Chariott so that you can focus on building your own scenarios.
